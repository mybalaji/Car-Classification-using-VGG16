# Car-Classification-using-VGG16

#Project Structure

The project uses a Transfer Learning approach with the VGG16 architecture, leveraging pre-trained weights from ImageNet and adding custom fully connected layers for classification.

Images are pre-processed and resized to match the input size expected by VGG16.
The project involves training on a custom dataset and testing the model's accuracy in distinguishing between car brands.
